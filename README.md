# World_Clock_OOP
This is my first try of OOP.


I did put Los Angeles as the local time and it could be edited easily or could be automatically picking the local time zone if there is a need. 
The time zone is writen in "Olson TZ name" style so that the user can choose the city they want. 
The city and continent dictionary could be in more content I did just put some cities well-known to me in the list.
In the future editing, the UTC time zone and "if it is day time saving" could be chosen by the user. But this would require the user know their local time zone.
